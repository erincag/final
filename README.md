# 2023 Post-Season Performance Review

## *PM566 Final Project Website and Report*

Erin Cagle

This project utilizes a publicly available data set provided by Micheal Hegedusich. This data is all theoretical and does not represent any true soccer team's data. It includes data that would be collected via GPS: distance, acceleration, deceleration, and max velocity. In addition, it includes data that would be self-reported by players: Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), Sleep Duration, Sleep Score, Sleep Quality, Soreness, and Stress. All of this data is typically used by sports scientists to make decisions about training, player readiness, and athlete management. The goal of this project was to identify trends within the various metrics included in the data set.

The website for this project includes 5 interactive graphs and a brief description in addition to a downloadable PDF of the full report.
